In this section, we will discuss two common techniques employed by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to a victim’s system or account
## Brute Force Attacks
Brute Force attacks are a trial-and-error method used by attackers to discover the correct credential combinations (username and password) to gain unauthorized access to an account or system. This is done by systematically trying as many possibilities as possible until the correct combination is found.

In a Brute Force attack, the attacker usually utilizes automated tools to generate and test numerous password combinations. This strategy can be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and potentially detectable due to the massive number of login attempts made in a short period.

## Protecting Against Brute Force Attacks
To mitigate the risks of a Brute Force attack, implement the following best practices:

**Strong password policies:** Encourage users to create complex and unique passwords, combining upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.


**Account lockout policies:** Lock user accounts temporarily after a set number of unsuccessful login attempts.

**Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA to make it more difficult for attackers to gain access, even if they obtain the correct credentials.
